# scatterpie-over-map
help with distorted scatterpies with scatterpie package over a map. Basically, I am trying to plot three pies over a stadiamap of Italy. Depending on the use of the coord_equal() option, I get either: a) a correct Italy with distorted pies; or b) correct pies over a distorted Italy.  A simple example follows. If your email server does not allow email messages that contain code, I can share the file.
